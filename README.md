# Predictive Analysis of Heart Failure Risk Factors 

## Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of heart failure by analyzing a dataset containing various clinical features. Through data visualization and predictive analytics, we explore key factors contributing to heart failure and provide insights for healthcare professionals.

## Key Features Explored
1. **Age:**
   - Investigating age-related patterns to discern trends or age-specific risk factors associated with heart failure.

2. **Cholesterol Levels:**
   - Visualizing cholesterol levels distribution to identify potential links between cholesterol and the likelihood of heart failure.

3. **Types of Chest Pain:**
   - Exploring the different types of chest pain within the dataset for understanding it's associaation to Heart Failure

4. **Risk Factor Assessment:**
   - Analyzing the impact of various risk factors on the likelihood of heart failure to enhance predictive capabilities.

## Data Description

1. Age -	Age of a patient [years]
2. ChestPain -	Chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
3. RestingBP -	Blood pressure in Hg (Normal blood pressure - 120/80 Hg)
4. Cholesterol -	Serum cholestrol level in blood (Normal cholesterol level below for adults 200mg/dL)
5. FastingBS -	Fasting Blood Sugar (Normal less than 100mg/dL for non diabetes for diabetes 100-125mg/dL)
6. RestingECG -	Resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions   and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
7. MaxHR -	Maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
8. ExerciseAngina -	Exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
9. Oldpeak -	oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
10. ST_Slope -	The slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
11. HeartDisease -	output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]

## Visualisation Types
1. Heatmaps- Heat maps are powerful visualizations that provide an intuitive way to explore associations and patterns in tabular data. In the context of my project, heat maps are used to analyze the relationship between age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and heart failure.

2. Pairplot- A pair plot, often created using the pairplot function in Seaborn, is a grid of scatterplots that allows one to visualize relationships between pairs of variables in a dataset. It's a quick and effective way to explore the joint distribution of multiple variables and identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations.
